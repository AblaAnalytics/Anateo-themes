# Anateo-themes

  This repository contains seven JSON files with the following color themes: ${\color{red}Red}$, {\color{pink}Pink}, {\color{orange}Orange}, {\color{green}Green}, {\color{blue}Blue}, {\color{yellow}Yellow}, and {\color{purple}Purple}.
  
  There are folders with the names of the theme colors ('red', 'pink', 'orange', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple'). 
  
  Each folder contains two files with styles for the light and dark themes('light_theme.json' and 'dark_theme.json').




## The URL to the JSON files with the different color themes

For getting the JSON object with the color themes need to use URL such format:

`https://ablaanalytics.github.io/Anateo-themes/<name of the theme color>/<light or dark>_theme.json`

For example, `https://ablaanalytics.github.io/Anateo-themes/red/light_theme.json`

You can try entering the URL from the example into the address bar of a browser tab, and an JSON object with styles for the red light theme will be available to you.
